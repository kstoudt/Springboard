# [A Comparative Analysis of Approaches to Music Genre Recognition (MGR)](https://github.com/kstoudt/Springboard/tree/main/Portfolio_Projects/Music_Genre_Recognition_Comparative_Analysis)

This project applies and compares 3 machine learning approaches to MGR â€“ Classical ML, Custom-Built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transfer Learning with pre-trained TensorFlow models.

- **Technical skills applied:** Google Colab, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Librosa, feature extraction with audio data, audio signal data processing, computer vision (CV), confusion matrix, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Mel-Scaled Spectrograms, CNNs, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, model evaluation and selection, cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization

# [Leveraging Hospital Data to Predict Diabetic Patient Readmission with XGBoost](https://github.com/kstoudt/Springboard/tree/main/Portfolio_Projects/Predicting_Diabetic_Patient_Readmission)

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a Machine Learning model to analyze and predict patient readmission at hospitals.

- **Technical skills applied:** JupyterNotebook, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, oversampling, probability thresholding, ROC-AUC curve, classification reports, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, model evaluation and selection, cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization
